## RustBridge is a workshop focused on getting underrepresented people with a background in another programming language to learn Rust and join the community.

### Why RustBridge?

RustBridge is an excellent way to welcome and attract persons from underrepresented backgrounds to your Rust conference or event. By giving students new to Rust an introduction to the language and other fellow Rust learners before the conference, RustBridge increases the relevance and value of Rust event content for students, as well as offering students a sense of belonging and camaraderie, both of which are things new members to a community often lack. Students of previously run Bridge programs often cite the Bridge Program as the reason they felt comfortable attending the event, and that the program greatly increased their enjoyment of the event.

### Why Rust?

[Rust](https://rust-lang.org) is a programming language designed to improve the experience of systems programming and thereby empower a broader range of people to write systems-level code. Systems programming has a reputation for being difficult and learners are often dissuaded by the culture's celebration of this difficulty. By contrast, the Rust Language team focuses specifically on [learning and beginner experiences](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-roadmap-2017/issues/3), and has key initiatives, such as the ergonomics initiative, to ensure that this critical work happens.
