# Contributing to `rustbridge-www`

Welcome! We're so glad you're here. If you'd like to contirbute to this
project we'd love to have you. Here's a few things about the project that
you should know before opening a PR on the project.

## Commit Messages

Please format your commit message the following way:

### 1. Prefix with `feat():` or `fix():`

Your patch can be considered either a feature or a bug fix. Write the above
text and provide a category within the parantheses. Use your best judgement
regarding what category to use. 

### 2. All lowercase

There's no arguing with style. I just like it this way and think it's easier 
to read.

### 3. Present tense

A commit log should read like a recipe. Use the active tense in your message
to ensure this is the case.

### Examples:

- `feat(doc): add instructions to the README`
- `fix(doc): fix typo in templating doc`
- `feat(build): implement and use a layout pattern`

There are many more examples in the [commit log]!
