          <h2>About RustBridge</h2>
<p>RustBridge is a workshop focused on getting underrepresented people with
a background in another programming language to learn Rust and join the
community.</p>
<h3>Why RustBridge?</h3>
<p>RustBridge is an excellent way to welcome and attract persons from
underrepresented backgrounds to your Rust conference or event. By giving
students new to Rust an introduction to the language and other fellow Rust
learners before the conference, RustBridge increases the relevance and
value of Rust event content for students, as well as offering students a
sense of belonging and camaraderie, both of which are things new members
to a community often lack. Students of previously run Bridge programs often
cite the Bridge Program as the reason they felt comfortable attending the
event, and that the program greatly increased their enjoyment of the event.</p>
<h3>Why Rust?</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.rust-lang.org">Rust is a programming language</a> designed to improve the experience of systems
programming and thereby empower a broader range of people to write
systems-level code. Systems programming has a reputation for being difficult
and learners are often dissuaded by the culture's celebration of this difficulty.
By contrast, the Rust Language team focuses specifically on
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-roadmap/issues/3">learning and beginner experiences</a>, and has key initiatives, such as  the
ergonomics initiative, to ensure that this critical work happens.</p>
<p>Additionally, from the start, Rust has had a <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/conduct.html">code of conduct</a> and has strived
for an inclusive and welcoming community. A strong <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/team.html#Moderation-team">moderation team</a>,
and <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-roadmap/issues/13">community initiatives</a> like <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2017/06/27/Increasing-Rusts-Reach.html">Rust Reach</a>, ensure that students attending
RustBridge have a safe and motivating place should they choose to continue
participating in the Rust ecosystem.</p>
<p>Given its explicit technical and social goals, Rust is well-suited for
a bridge program focused on bringing underrepresented persons and
beginners into its community.</p>
